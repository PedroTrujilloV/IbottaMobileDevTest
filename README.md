This my Ibotta Mobile Developer Test, in this repo you can find a sample app that fill the [requirements](https://github.com/PedroTrujilloV/IbottaMobileDevTest/tree/master/IbottaMobileDevTest) for this test. This app also uses some cool stuff like the Apples FRP API,  [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine) framework to handle the states for some of its features. This app implements [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) as its design architecture, trying to follow SOLID principles. Also use some usefull tools from internet.

### Thanks for looking!
